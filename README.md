# Module Five Challenge Report

## Overview
---

A summary data frame need to be created and it will contain the ride-sharing data by city type. Later on, the dataframe will be utilized to plot a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. This generated plot will be used to extract insights which can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

From the above figure:
- The average fare for each driver is the lowest in the urban areas, and the highest in the rural communities. As for the average fare per ride, it is the cheapest in the urban city type, and the most expensive in the rural areas. 
- The total number of drivers is ordered as follows, urban, suburban, rural. 
- The total number of rides is sorted in the following manner, urban, suburban, and rural.

From the above figure:
- The urban fare flactuates around $2000. 
- The suburban fare is almost constant at $1000.
- the rural fare flactuates around $250, 

## Summary
---

- The driving earning in the urban areas where it is the most expensive is the lowest compared to the other city types which needs to be addressed either by lowering the number of drivers or increasing the fare cost. 
- the cost of the fare in the rural comunities is the most expensive which may lead in reduction in the number of rides in the future. Acoordingly, lowering the fare cost is needed. 
- The number of drivers shouldn't be increased in any city type as the demand seems to be constant from the total fare by city type figure.
